**Abstract**

This study investigates the impact of geographical proximity on the activity rate in the communes of Ille-et-Vilaine in 2021, using spatial econometric methods. By exploring how socio-economic characteristics and neighborhood interactions influence activity rates, the analysis incorporates spatial autocorrelation to model local dynamics rigorously. Key explanatory variables include living standards, entrepreneurial activity, population demographics, and local infrastructure.

The findings reveal that traditional models, such as OLS and SLX, fail to address spatial autocorrelation adequately, limiting their reliability. In contrast, the Spatial Autoregressive (SAR) model successfully accounts for spatial effects, providing robust results. The analysis highlights the significant influence of the active population and local entrepreneurial activity on economic performance, with noticeable spatial spillover effects. However, variables like living standards show limited direct impact, suggesting other socio-economic or policy factors may play a larger role.

These results emphasize the importance of considering spatial dynamics in understanding the drivers of local economic activity and inform strategies to promote sustainable economic development in regional contexts.

**Note:** To run the code, in addition to the **fusion.xlsx** file containing all indicators for the communes, the shapefile of the communes in France is also required. It is too large to be included directly here, but it can be accessed on the following website: [https://www.data.gouv.fr/](https://www.data.gouv.fr/).  

Additionally, the resulting **HTML file** from the analysis is very large and cannot be directly viewed online. Users are encouraged to **download it for offline reading.**
